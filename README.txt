This folder contains the documentation of the project as design as well as the programs created to streamline the process in a self-contained manner.

To review the project code, it is recommend that the user start by reviewing the html output (within the "Outputs" folder) as that is run everytime the batch file (Run_QCreport_Auto.bat)

To gain more understanding of the process design, it is recommend that the user read "Daily Metrics DB Automation Documentation.xlsx"
